    <h2>What I hope to get out of IS 413:</h2>
    <p>
        I hope to get to know the C# language and understand how to make a complex web application. I hope to increase my programming knowledge
        and be well versed in how enterprise-level applications are developed. If I get a project management job,
        this knowledge will help me communicate effectively with my team members about programming projects.
